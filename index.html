					<h2>Things to Consider Before You Buy</h2>
					<p>Contemplating the life cycle of every item you purchase is an important way to put the environmental impact into context. Many of our purchases have unanticipated consequences and taking these questions into consideration can help you make better choices about your clothing purchases. Asking yourself questions such as: <br> Where was this made? Who was it made by? How was it transported to the seller it and how did it move from the seller to me?<br>How much will I wear this item? How long will I keep it? What shape will it be in once I am done with it?<br>Where will this go after I no longer want it? Could it be resold? Will I donate it or will it end up in a landfill?<br><br>Take some time to consider the clothes you already have. Try to identify trends in your favorite garments. When you determine why you love what you love, you can look for those attributes in your future purchases. Pay attention to your preferences in textures, fabrics, and colors as well. Don't forget to look at all the things you're clearing out of your closet, you might find some insight there as well. When you can determine what you do love to wear, and the things you don't love to wear you can make better choices about what you buy. While you're examining your closet, take some time to rearrange it. You can spark creativity by organizing your things in a new way. I like to organize things by color instead of by occasion, I often see an opportunity to wear an item in a way I hadn't considered before. Being intentional about our purchases is the first step to reducing our consumption.</p>

					<h2>Invest in the Best Items You Can Afford</h2>
					<p>In recent decades, our society's relationship with our clothes has shifted drastically in two ways that can have major impacts on the planet. We have more clothes than we ever have in human history. At the same time, the percentage of our earnings that are spent on clothes has dropped. We are buying poor quality clothes and we are buying a lot more of them. The production of apparel, particularly fast fashion, wastes large amounts of clean water and has a significant carbon footprint.
<br>Investing in better clothes can help slow down our consumption. When we spend more on higher quality pieces, we are more likely to keep them longer. Focus on the construction of the garment and fabric quality when evaluating an item. You are naturally going to spend more time making sure you're making the right choice when investing a lot in a particular item. Use that to the earth's advantage!<br>Investing in getting clothes altered and tailored can help minimize the amount we buy. Properly fitting clothes look better and the better we look in an item, the more likely we are to keep it for a long time. Most alterations and tailor shops are locally owned and it's a simple way to support small business owners in your community. Building relationships with these shops can come in handy when something needs to be repaired.</p>

					<h2>The Care &amp; Keeping of Your Clothes</h2>
					<p>Taking care of your clothes properly is the best way to reduce consumption. When washing our clothes became easier, we started washing them more than we need to. An easy way to save water is to only wash your clothes when necessary. Not every item needs to be cleaned every time it is worn. Clothes that are visibly dirty or are starting to smell should be washed, as well activewear, and underwear; everything else can hang around for a bit. When you are getting dressed, choosing layers can reduce the amount of clothes that you need to clean. Before you wash anything, read the instructions for care. This will save you from accidentally damaging your clothes and having to get rid of them. Wash your sweaters and other delicate items by hand, not the delicate cycle on the washing machine. Whenever possible, hang your clothes on a line to let them air dry. This will save energy while helping to prevent shrinkage, minimize pilling, and reduce skew and holes in the fabric. Don't ever put activewear in the dryer, it can cause buildup on the fibers that can cause irritation to the skin and can ruin treatments to the fabric that will impact it's performance. Natural hair sweaters will shrink in the dryer; letting them dry flat is the best way to take care of them. Once you are ready to wear your clothes, using a steamer to get rid of the wrinkles in your clothes is much gentler than an iron and takes up much less space in your home. Tools like a sweater shaver can remove pilling from your clothes and leave them looking brand new. </p>

					<p>Purchasing vintage options is the most eco-friendly way to shop! It's a great way to add whimsical pieces or of the moment trend items that you may not wear as often without creating additional waste. But buying vintage clothing can be very time consuming. There are a lot of ways to make it easier. Follow vintage sellers on your social media accounts. This is easy way to find items you love while you're scrolling and you won't be as tempted to impulse buy something from an ad. Have your measurements easily accessible so that you can make quick decisions before someone else snags the item you're interested in. My favorite vintage find was a wicker handbag that was featured on an instagram story from May's Place. In addition to this, you can use the saved searches feature on apps like eBay to minimize the effort you have to put in. When doing this, it's key to know what you're looking for and have the right keywords to get the results you want. Brands, season and year, the name of style are crucial to finding the thing you're searching for. A quick search should have you ready to find what you want. Vintage shopping can be very demanding but incredibly rewarding.</p>
